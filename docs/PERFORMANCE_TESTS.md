# PERFORMANCE TESTS

create a clone from a template
create a similar structured from scratch
never get confused with static methods not being able to call instance methods directly
always be able to git clone ANY student's repo of any type into any workspace without confusion or name clobbering
imports directly and immediately as a maven project
pom file is written properly and not mis named or otherwise
includes at least one junit test case
absolute minimum amount of slowdown on git, git tooling, IDE and IDE tooling
emphasize the corporate standard setup
example projects should be each of invisible, runnable, and present with the assignment
remove as many infrastructure/tooling obstacles from coding assignments:
- teach coding
- or teach tooling/setup
- not both at same time, especially to start with
"It just works"
